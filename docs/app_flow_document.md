## Introduction

The Gun Club Scoring Web Application is designed to modernize score tracking for shooting sports. Traditional methods like spreadsheets and manual record-keeping are prone to inefficiencies and errors. This application aims to streamline score tracking, provide insightful performance statistics, and enhance field management for gun clubs. The users, including club managers and shooters, will experience a seamless journey from signing up to managing scores and club operations.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users discover the Gun Club Scoring Web Application through a landing page, direct invitation, or promotions by the gun club itself. Upon accessing the main page of the app, they are prompted to join a club, either by searching for an existing club or creating a new one, thus becoming a club manager. Users must be associated with at least one club.

Users opting to sign up provide their email and create a password with a simple form backed by Supabase's secure authentication system. Once the sign-up process concludes, they receive a confirmation email to verify their credentials. Returning users can sign in using their email and password combination. The app also offers password recovery via a verification link sent to the registered email.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successful login, users are directed to the main dashboard tailored to their roleâ€”shooter or club manager. Shooters have prominent access to score tracking, performance analytics, and gun management. Club managers access member management, competition oversight, and field management options. The interface uses a navigation bar and sidebar for easy access to different modules, ensuring users have the necessary tools at their fingertips.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
