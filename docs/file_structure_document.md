### Introduction

A well-organized file structure is the backbone of any successful software project. It provides a clear guide for developers and stakeholders, ensuring the project is easy to maintain, understand, and expand upon. Such organization is crucial for collaborative environments, allowing team members to efficiently navigate the codebase, make updates, and implement features. In this context, we are developing a Gun Club Scoring Web Application designed to modernize score tracking and management for shooting clubs, eliminating traditional inefficiencies and inaccuracies.

### Overview of the Tech Stack

The Gun Club Scoring Web Application utilizes a modern technology stack, with React.js for the frontend, Node.js for backend operations, and Supabase for data storage and authentication. This combination allows for responsive user interfaces, real-time data updates, and secure handling of user information. The tech stack significantly influences our file structure by dictating modularity and best practices unique to React and Node.js environments, such as the separation of frontend and backend concerns and the use of environment-specific configuration files.

### Root Directory Structure

The root directory forms the initial layer of the project, containing essential folders and files that define the project environment and configurations. Key directories include:

*   **src/**: Contains the source code for both frontend and backend components.
*   **public/**: Includes static assets like HTML files and icons used by the frontend.
*   **config/**: Houses configuration files for various environments and services.
*   **docs/**: Stores documentation related to the application’s development and usage. Important files at the root level may consist of `package.json` for managing dependencies and scripts, `README.md` for a project overview, `webpack.config.js` for build configuration, and `.env` files for environment-specific variables.

### Frontend File Structure

The frontend code resides within the `src/frontend` directory. Here, the structure focuses on modularity and reusability facilitated by React’s component-based architecture. It includes:

*   **components/**: Reusable React components organized by functionality or feature.
*   **styles/**: Stylesheets, preferably using CSS modules or styled-components, to keep styles scoped and manageable.
*   **assets/**: Static resources like images and fonts used by the frontend.
*   **hooks/**: Custom React hooks providing reusable logic across components.
*   **utils/**: Helper functions and utilities. This organization supports code separation and makes it easier to manage updates or debug specific UI components.

### Backend File Structure

The backend logic is housed in the `src/backend` directory, reflecting Node.js standards. The structure aims to support scalability and maintainability:

*   **controllers/**: Contains logic to handle API requests and responses.
*   **models/**: Defines data models and schemas, interfacing with the Supabase database.
*   **routes/**: Specifies API endpoints and associates them with controller functions.
*   **services/**: Business logic and processes that interact with models and controllers.
*   **middlewares/**: Functions for request validation, authentication, and logging. Such a setup facilitates clear separation of concerns, crucial for sustainable backend development.

### Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration files within the `config/` directory are pivotal for setting up different environments like development, testing, and production. They include:

*   `.env`: Environment-specific variables for local development.
*   `config.json`: Contains configuration settings that are shared across environments.
*   `webpack.config.js`: Manages build processes for different environments. These files ensure that the application operates consistently across various stages of deployment, handling differences in settings and dependencies gracefully.

### Testing and Documentation Structure

Testing is integrated throughout the project to uphold quality. Tests are stored in a dedicated `tests/` directory, including unit and integration tests for various components and functions in both the frontend and backend. Documentation is organized under the `docs/` directory, comprised of markdown or HTML files that detail usage guides, developer notes, and API documentation. This distinct separation ensures that testing is prioritized alongside development, and thorough documentation aids in knowledge sharing and onboarding new developers.

### Conclusion and Overall Summary

In conclusion, an organized file structure is vital for the Gun Club Scoring Web Application, ensuring efficient development processes and ease of maintenance. By leveraging a structured approach based on the modern tech stack, we ensure each part of the project is easy to locate, update, and understand. The careful distinction between frontend and backend concerns, alongside thorough configuration and documentation practices, positions this project to effectively meet its goals of modernizing score tracking and management for gun clubs.
