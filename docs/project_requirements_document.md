## Gun Club Scoring Web Application

### Project Overview

The Gun Club Scoring Web Application is a digital platform designed to streamline and modernize the score tracking and management operations of gun clubs. It caters primarily to club managers and shooters, offering an efficient system for recording scores, managing club activities, and enhancing accuracy and accessibility of performance data. By moving away from traditional error-prone manual records, this application aims to provide a robust, digital solution that supports various shooting disciplines, offers insightful statistics, and integrates seamless field management capabilities for gun clubs.

The application is being developed to address several pain points faced by gun clubs such as inaccuracies in manual score-keeping, inefficient data management, limited statistical analysis capabilities, and cumbersome field management operations. The key objectives of this project are to reduce errors through automation, provide comprehensive and real-time performance analytics, ease the field setup process, and facilitate competition management to support clubs in optimizing their operations and enhancing shooters' engagement.

### In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Development of a web-based application accessible from both desktop and mobile browsers.
*   Features for score tracking across various disciplines like Skeet and Trap shooting.
*   Club management functionalities including editing club information and managing members.
*   Field management features for setting up shooting fields and maintenance scheduling.
*   Responsive user interface with real-time update capabilities.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Development of a dedicated mobile application.
*   Offline functionality for score tracking and data retrieval.
*   Integration with external systems like payment gateways or social media platforms.
*   Advanced analytics beyond basic performance metrics.

### User Flow

A typical journey for a user starts with registering or logging into the application through a secure authentication system managed by Supabase. Once logged in, the user lands on a dashboard that presents data relevant to their role, whether they are a club manager or a shooter. For shooters, this dashboard offers options to record new scores, view past performances, and manage their personal gun configurations in an intuitive card-based layout.

Club managers access a more comprehensive section where they can edit club details, configure field settings, view comprehensive club-wide statistics, manage members, and oversee field maintenance schedules. Navigating through the application remains seamless across devices, with mobile-specific designs offering larger interactive buttons and swipe gestures for easier access to essential functions like score tracking.

### Core Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system using Supabase Auth.
*   **Dashboard:** Role-specific dashboard with relevant data and options.
*   **Score Tracking:** Real-time recording of scores, with options to filter results and view detailed breakdowns.
*   **Club Management:** Tools for club managers to edit club information and manage member roles.
*   **Field Management:** Dynamic setup for shooting fields, including maintenance scheduling.
*   **Statistics and Analytics:** Comprehensive individual and club-wide performance metrics.
*   **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly interface ensuring easy navigation and usability.

### Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:** React.js for building responsive user interfaces.
*   **Backend:** Node.js for server-side logic and operations.
*   **Database:** Supabase for data storage, user authentication, and real-time updates.
*   **AI Tools:** Bolt for project setup, Claude and ChatGPT for code generation, and Cursor for advanced IDE support with real-time suggestions.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Page load times under 2 seconds, smooth real-time updates.
*   **Security:** HTTPS encryption, secure API endpoints, regular data backup.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive interface, mobile-responsive design, compliance with accessibility standards.
*   **Scalability:** System designed to handle a growing number of users and data entries efficiently.

### Constraints & Assumptions

*   Requires a stable internet connection for real-time functionality.
*   Assumes users have access to modern web browsers.
*   Data operations depend on the availability and reliability of the Supabase service.

### Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   Potential API rate limits with Supabase might affect real-time data processing.
*   Cross-browser compatibility issues could arise, necessitating extensive testing.
*   Real-time updates might strain server resources as user load increases, requiring careful resource management.
